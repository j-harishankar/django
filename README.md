## 📅 **DAY 1: Project Setup and Basics**

### ✅ Creating a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv <env_name>
```

> Activate the environment (no path needed if VS Code is opened from the root directory).

### ✅ Installing Django and Dependencies

* Install Django and other required packages after activating the virtual environment.

---

## 🛠️ Creating a Django Project and App

### ▶️ Creating the Project

```bash
django-admin startproject <project_name>
```

* Creates a Django project with the same folder name.
* Multiple apps can exist within one project.

### ▶️ Creating an App

```bash
python manage.py startapp <app_name>
```

### ▶️ Running the Project

```bash
cd <project_name>
python manage.py runserver
```

---

## 📁 Important Django Files

### `views.py`

* Contains functions to handle HTTP requests and return responses.

### `settings.py`

* Main configuration file for:

  * Installed applications
  * Middleware
  * Templates
  * Database setup

### ⚠️ Tip: Always open VS Code from the root directory containing `manage.py`.

### 🔄 Django Request-Response Cycle

* A request hits the URL pattern.
* The mapped view function returns an HTTP response.

---

## ✅ Summary of Day 1

* Created a Django project and app
* Understood what an app is in Django
* Learned Django’s request-response cycle
* Explored basic Django file structure

---

## 📁 GitHub Commands

### ✨ Set Up Local Repo as GitHub Repo

```bash
git init
git remote add origin <http>
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

### ⚡ If a README already exists before pushing:

```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push origin main
```

---

## 📄 Django Templates

### ✨ About Templates

* Define the structure/layout of web pages
* Use plain HTML + Django Template Language (DTL)

### ✅ Steps to Use Templates

1. Create a template directory
2. Add path in `settings.py`
3. Create `.html` files
4. Write views to render templates
5. Map templates in `urls.py`

### 🌟 `render()` Function

```python
render(request, template_name, context=None, content_type=None, status=None, using=None)
```

### ✨ Example HTML Syntax

```django
{% for item in dict %}
  {{ item }}
{% endfor %}
```

---

## 📅 DAY 3: URL Management Tips

* For cleaner code, define URLs inside individual apps (e.g., `movies.py`) instead of cramming everything into the main app's `urls.py`.

---

## ➜ Hyperlinks in Django

### Example:

```html
<ul>
  <li><a href="{% url 'create' %}">Create</a></li>
</ul>
```

* `<ul>` creates an unordered (bulleted) list.
* `<li>` defines each item.
* `<a>` is a hyperlink tag. `href` sets the URL.

---

## ➜ Include Tag

```django
{% include 'filename.html' %}
```

---

##  Template Inheritance

### ✨ Extending Templates

```django
{% extends 'base.html' %}
```

* Overriding content using blocks:

```django
{% block content %}
  {% include 'menu.html' %}
  <h1>Create</h1>
{% endblock %}
```

* Use when reusing common layouts like navbars but customizing the main content.

## 📅 DAY 5

### ✅ Steps to Use Templates

- Static files are just external files that you use in Django like images, JS, CSS, etc...
  
- ➜ Ensure `django.contrib.staticfiles` is included in your `INSTALLED_APPS`.

- ➜ In your `settings.py`, define `STATIC_URL`, for example:
    ```python
    STATIC_URL = "static/"
    ```

---

### 🔧 Why `STATICFILES_DIRS` is Important

`STATICFILES_DIRS` tells Django:

> “Hey, in addition to app-specific static folders, also check these extra directories for static files.”

#### ✅ When can you skip `STATICFILES_DIRS`?
You can omit it safely **only if**:

- You’re storing all your images, CSS, and JS inside an app’s `static/` folder.

📂 **Helpful Reference**:
- `movie.html`
- `views.py` (`movie_manager/movies`)
- `settings.py`
- `urls.py` (inside `movies` app)

---

## 📅 DAY 6

### ✅ Performing CRED Operations

#### 🧾 Handling Forms in Django


### 🔹 What's Going On Here?

```html
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    {% csrf_token %}
    Title : <input type="text" name="title" />
    year : <input type="text" name="year" />
    summary : <input type="text" name="summary" />
    <button type="submit">create</button>
</form>
```

* `<form method="post">`:
  Forms are how users send data to the server (like filling out a form on a website).
  `method="post"` means the browser will send the form data inside the **body** of the request, which is private.
  The alternative is `method="get"`, where data is **visible in the URL**.

* `enctype="multipart/form-data"`:
  This is used when you're uploading files (like images). It tells the browser to encode the form properly.
  Even though you’re not uploading files here, it's okay to include — or you can remove it if not needed.

* `{% csrf_token %}`:
  Django uses this for **security**.
  CSRF = Cross Site Request Forgery. This token ensures the form was submitted from your site and not by a hacker.
  If you forget this line, Django will block the form submission.

* `<input type="text" name="title" />`:
  This creates a text field.
  `name="title"` is the key you'll use to access this data in Django.

---

### 🔹 The Django View:

```python
def create(request):
    if request.POST:
        print(request.POST.get("title"))
        print(request.POST.get("year"))
        print(request.POST.get("summary"))

    return render(request, 'create.html')
```

---

### 🔹 What Does This Mean?

* **`request`**:
  This is an object Django gives you automatically.
  It contains everything about the current user’s request — method (GET or POST), data, user info, etc.

* **`if request.POST:`**
  Checks if the request has POST data (i.e., the user submitted the form).
  ✅ **Better practice**: Use `if request.method == "POST"` — it's more explicit and reliable.

* **`request.POST.get("title")`**:
  Gets the value the user typed into the `"title"` input.
  You use `.get()` so it doesn’t crash if the field is missing.

* **`render(request, 'create.html')`**:
  This renders the HTML template called `create.html`.
  Django sends the HTML page as a **response** back to the browser.
  Even after the form is submitted, we send back the same page — you can later change this to **redirect** or show a **success message**.

---  
## 📅 DAY 7

### ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

* ORM is an approach that uses object-oriented programming to manipulate the data in the relational database.
* Django ORM allows you to use the same Python API that interacts with various relational databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, ORACLE...
* i.e., no need to write SQL queries; instead, write class-based models and the ORM will translate them into SQL queries.

### **`models.py`**

* Used to write classes for managing the data using classes.

* While creating a class, you shall inherit `Models` from Django's `models` module.

* After creating a model class, run:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```

This creates a corresponding migration file, but the table won't be visible yet. It basically generates migration scripts.

* Now run:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This will create the table in the database.

* You will notice several other tables created automatically — these are default features or tables provided by the Django framework.

---

### 🔧 `python manage.py makemigrations`

This command **creates new migration files** based on the changes you made to your models (in `models.py`).

#### Example:

If you add a new model like this:

```python
from django.db import models

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()
```

Then run:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```

📅 Django will create a migration file like:
`migrations/0001_initial.py`
This file contains Python code that describes how to create the `Student` table in your database.

> 💡 Think of this as Django **recording the changes** you want to make to the database.

---

### 🛠️ `python manage.py migrate`

This command **applies the migration files** to the actual database.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

📅 It creates or updates tables in the database according to the migrations.

> 💡 Think of this as **applying the recorded changes** to the real database.

---

### 🔁 Summary

| Command                           | Purpose                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `python manage.py makemigrations` | Detects changes in models and creates migration files |
| `python manage.py migrate`        | Applies the changes to the database                   |

---

* `id` is a primary key

---

### 📝 Storing Form Data in the Database in Django

Once you have:

* Created a **model** and applied **migrations**,
* And created a **form in your view**,

Then, instead of printing the submitted values to the terminal, you can **store them in the database**.

To do this, you need to:

1. Create an **object of the model class** (which represents the table).
2. Assign the form values to that object.
3. Save the object using `.save()`.

---

### ✅ Example

```python
from .models import MyModel

def create(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        title = request.POST.get("title")
        year = request.POST.get("year")
        summary = request.POST.get("summary")

        # Create and save the object
        obj = MyModel(title=title, year=year, summary=summary)
        obj.save()

    return render(request, 'create.html')
```

This will save the submitted form data into the database table represented by `MyModel`.

Let me know if you want to use Django forms instead of manual `request.POST.get`.

---

* Note:

```python
from .models import MovieInfo
```

The `.` means: "import from the same package (i.e., the same app directory)."





### ✅ **Improved & Structured Version (with Explanation)**

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import MovieInfo  # Make sure you import your model

def cred(request):
    # Step 1: Fetch all movie records from the MovieInfo table
    all_movies = MovieInfo.objects.all()

    # Step 2: Print the queryset in the console (for debugging)
    print(all_movies)

    # Step 3: Pass the movies to the template using context
    return render(request, 'cred.html', {'movies': all_movies})
```

---

### 🧠 **Understanding `Model.objects.method()`**

In Django, you use this structure to interact with the database:

```
ModelName.objects.method()
```

* ✅ `ModelName` – Your model class (e.g., `MovieInfo`)
* ✅ `.objects` – The manager that allows database queries
* ✅ `.method()` – The query method (e.g., `all()`, `filter()`, `get()`, etc.)

---

### 🔍 Example in Plain English

> *“Give me all the records from the `MovieInfo` table.”*
> That’s what this line does:

```python
MovieInfo.objects.all()
```

---

### 📌 Summary Rule

> **Always access the database in Django using:**
> `Model.objects.method()`
> *(This keeps your code clean, predictable, and Djangoic.)*

---

Let me know if you want to also display these movies inside the `cred.html` template — I can guide you step by step.

## 📅 DAY 8



### django-admin interface

## 🧭 Why We Use Django `/admin` Interface

### 🔹 1. **Instant Dashboard for Managing Data**

* Add, edit, and delete records (like tasks, users, blog posts) **without writing code or SQL**.
* Acts as a built-in GUI for your database.

> 📌 Example: Want to test your `Task` model? Use `/admin` to add 5 tasks quickly instead of writing views or forms.

---

### 🔹 2. **Auto-generated & Customizable**

* Django auto-builds admin pages for your models.
* You can **customize filters, search fields, ordering, etc.**

---

### 🔹 3. **Saves Time in Early Development**

* Test your app logic **before** building full front-end UIs.

---

### 🔹 4. **Used by Real Projects Too**

* Many teams use Django admin for internal tools.
* You can **limit access to staff only**.

---

### ⚙️ How It Works (Conceptually)

1. Register your models in `admin.py`.
2. Django creates admin pages.
3. Login at `/admin` using a superuser account.
4. Manage all model data easily.

---



## 🧾 Why We Register Models in Django Admin


Registering a model in `admin.py` tells Django to **show it in the `/admin` panel**.

---

### 🔍 Without registering:

* Model exists in the database.
* But **won’t show up in the admin panel**.
* You **can’t manage its data visually**.

---

### 🧠 Think of it like this:

> "Django, I’ve created this model. Please include it in the admin panel so I can manage its data visually."

---

### 🔧 What registering does:

* Adds the model to the `/admin` sidebar.
* Enables **create/edit/delete** from admin UI.
* Allows testing data **without building frontend views**.
* Makes future customizations possible (search, filters, etc.).

---

### ✅ Summary

| Purpose                           | Result                                  |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Registering a model in `admin.py` | Model shows up in `/admin`              |
| Not registering it                | Admin dashboard won’t show that model   |
| Use case                          | Easy data management during development |

* eg: 
```from . models import MovieInfo
# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(MovieInfo)
```
### creating superuser :-

* python manage.py createsuperuser




### django shell 


### 🐚 What is the Django Shell?

The Django shell is an **interactive Python environment** that allows me to work directly with my Django project.  
I use it mainly for **testing and debugging**.

For example, I can **quickly create or retrieve database objects using my models**, without having to set up views or templates.  
This helps me verify that my **logic and database interactions** are working correctly.

---

### 🔧 Why is it useful?

It’s especially useful during development when I want to:

- ✅ Check if a query returns the correct results  
- ✅ Manually create or edit data  
- ✅ Test small pieces of logic without affecting the frontend

---

### 🚀 How do I open it?

```bash
python manage.py shell
````

This gives me **full access to my project’s models and settings**.
It’s like a **playground or lab** where I can safely test things without affecting the actual user interface.

---

### 💡 Bonus Example

If I have a `MovieInfo` model, I can do:

```python
from myapp.models import MovieInfo
MovieInfo.objects.create(title="Inception", director="Nolan", year=2010)
```
This creates a **movie record in the database instantly**, which I can then check in the **admin panel** or use in my **views**.


# 📄 Django ModelForm Guide

## 🧩 What is a ModelForm?

If you’re building a database-driven app, chances are you’ll have forms that map closely to Django models. For example, you might have a `BlogComment` model and want to create a form for users to submit comments.

In such cases, defining form fields again in a standard form is redundant, because the fields already exist in the model.

> **ModelForm** is a Django helper class that automatically generates a form based on your model.

##  Steps to Implement a ModelForm

### ✅ 1. Create `forms.py` in Your App Directory

Create a new file if it doesn't exist:

```
your_app/
├── models.py
├── views.py
├── forms.py  ← create this
```

### ✅ 2. Import Required Classes

In `forms.py`:

```python
from django.forms import ModelForm
from .models import YourModel  # Replace with your actual model
```

### ✅ 3. Create a Form Class

```python
class YourModelForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = YourModel
        fields = '__all__'  # or specify fields like ['title', 'description']
```

### ✅ 4. Use Form in Your View

In `views.py`:

```python
from .forms import YourModelForm

def your_view(request):
    form = YourModelForm()
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = YourModelForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
    return render(request, 'template.html', {'form': form})
```

### ✅ 5. Render Form in Your Template

In your `template.html`:

```html
<form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

# Day-9

## ✏️ Edit / 🗑️ Delete Operations in Django

This guide explains how to implement **Edit** and **Delete** functionality in a Django app using primary keys in URLs.

---

## 📌 Steps for Edit & Delete Operations

### 1. ✅ Add Primary Key to URL

Update `urls.py` to pass the primary key (`pk`) through the URL:

```python
from . import views
from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [
    path('edit/<pk>', views.edit, name='edit'),
    path('delete/<pk>', views.delete, name='delete'),
]
```

---

### 2. 🧠 Update Template to Pass Object ID

In your template (e.g., `cred.html`), add links for edit and delete, passing the `movieobj.id`:

```html
<td>
    <a href="{% url 'edit' movieobj.id %}">Edit</a> /
    <a href="{% url 'delete' movieobj.id %}">Delete</a>
</td>
```

---

## 🗑️ Delete Operation

### ✅ View (`views.py`)

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import MovieInfo

def delete(request, pk):
    instance = MovieInfo.objects.get(pk=pk)
    instance.delete()
    movie_set = MovieInfo.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'cred.html', {'movies': movie_set})
```

### 🔍 Explanation:

* `MovieInfo.objects.get(pk=pk)`: Retrieves the movie with the given primary key.
* `instance.delete()`: Deletes it from the database.
* `MovieInfo.objects.all()`: Fetches remaining movies.
* Renders the updated list in `cred.html`.

### 💡 Template Loop Example

```django
{% for movie in movies %}
    <p>{{ movie.title }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

---

## ✏️ Edit Operation

### ✅ View (`views.py`)

```python
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .models import MovieInfo

def edit(request, pk):
    instance = MovieInfo.objects.get(pk=pk)

    if request.method == "POST":
        title = request.POST.get("title")
        year = request.POST.get("year")
        description = request.POST.get("description")

        instance.title = title
        instance.year = year
        instance.description = description
        instance.save()

        return redirect('some_view_name')  # Replace with your actual view name

    return render(request, 'edit.html', {'movie': instance})
```

### ✅ Template (`edit.html`)

```html
<form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <label>Title:</label>
    <input type="text" name="title" value="{{ movie.title }}"><br><br>

    <label>Year:</label>
    <input type="number" name="year" value="{{ movie.year }}"><br><br>

    <label>Description:</label>
    <textarea name="description">{{ movie.description }}</textarea><br><br>

    <button type="submit">Update</button>
</form>
```

| Template Loop  | Display all current objects using `{% for obj in objects %} ... {% endfor %}`                    |

---

**Tip:**  
Always use the object's primary key in the URL for edit and delete operations to uniquely identify which row to update or remove.



# ✅ Day-10: Connecting PostgreSQL to Django

---

## 📦 Step 1: Install PostgreSQL Adapter

Use `psycopg2` to connect Django with PostgreSQL:

```bash
pip install psycopg2
```

---

## 🗄️ Step 2: Create a PostgreSQL Database

Create a new database inside your PostgreSQL shell (e.g., `psql`) using:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE your_db_name;
```

You can leave most fields as default; you’ll use these details in `settings.py`.

---

## ⚙️ Step 3: Update Django `settings.py`

Modify the `DATABASES` setting:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',  # Change from 'sqlite3'
        'NAME': 'your_db_name',
        'USER': 'your_username',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

---

## 🔁 Step 4: Handle Existing Migrations

Since previous migrations were done with SQLite, you'll need to migrate again for PostgreSQL.

But if you want to **keep existing data**, follow the steps below.

---

## ✅ How to Move Data When Switching from SQLite to PostgreSQL

### **Option 1: Using `dumpdata` and `loaddata`**

This lets you migrate both schema and data safely.

1. **Export Data from SQLite:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py dumpdata > data.json
   ```

2. **Switch DB to PostgreSQL in `settings.py` (as shown above).**

3. **Run migrations for the new DB:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Load data into PostgreSQL:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py loaddata data.json
   ```

This ensures your old data is loaded into your new PostgreSQL tables.

---

## 🧠 Why This Works with Django

If we weren’t using Django, we would have to:

* Write raw SQL queries manually to recreate all tables and relationships.

But Django uses **ORM (Object Relational Mapping)**:

* So we just change the DB backend, run `migrate`, and the models are auto-converted into the correct DB structure.
* No need to rewrite queries!


### 📘 Django Media Handling – Easy Notes

#### 🔹 What’s the purpose?

To let users **upload files (like images)** and display them dynamically on your site (not just static images you added yourself).

---

### 🛠️ Setup Steps

#### ✅ 1. Add an `ImageField` or `FileField` in your model:

```python
poster = models.ImageField(upload_to='posters/')
```

> `upload_to` decides the folder inside your `media/` directory.

---

#### ✅ 2. Set up `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT` in `settings.py`:

```python
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
```

---

#### ✅ 3. Tell Django to serve media in `urls.py` (only during development):

```python
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

---

### ⚠️ Common Gotchas

* Always run:

  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

  after adding new fields.

* In your template, check if file exists before showing:

  ```html
  {% if movie.poster %}
      <img src="{{ movie.poster.url }}" width="100">
  {% else %}
      No image uploaded
  {% endif %}
  ```

* Use `enctype="multipart/form-data"` in your form tag for file upload.




# ✅ Day-10: Learning ORM Relations in Django

## 🔗 One-to-One Relationship

### 📌 Concept:

* A **One-to-One relation** connects two models so that **each row in one model** is related to **exactly one row in another model**.
* In Django, this is achieved using `OneToOneField`.

### 🛠️ Steps:

1. **Create the related model first** (e.g., `CensorInfo`).
2. **Use that model as a field** in another model using `models.OneToOneField`.

### 🧠 Tip:

> When a new instance is created in the second model (e.g., `CensorInfo`), it can be linked to **only one** instance in the main model (e.g., `MovieInfo`).

## 🐚 Using the Django Shell Efficiently

### 🚫 Instead of:

* Writing views and running the server every time just to test data operations.

### ✅ Do this:

* Use the Django shell to interact with models directly. It’s faster for testing and learning.

### 💻 Example:

```python
>>> from movies.models import CensorInfo, MovieInfo

# Get an existing movie
>>> movie_obj = MovieInfo.objects.get(title='batman')

# Create a new CensorInfo and assign it to the movie
>>> movie_obj.censor = CensorInfo.objects.create(rating='a', certified_by='IMDB')

# Access the censor info
>>> movie_obj.censor
<CensorInfo: CensorInfo object (2)>

>>> print(movie_obj.censor)
CensorInfo object (2)

# Access a specific field
>>> movie_obj.censor.rating
'a'
```


```
chatgpt example:


>>> censor_obj = CensorInfo.objects.create(rating='A', certified_by='IMDB')

>>> movie1 = MovieInfo.objects.get(title='Batman')
>>> movie2 = MovieInfo.objects.get(title='Superman')

>>> movie1.censor = censor_obj
>>> movie2.censor = censor_obj   # ❗ This will override movie1's link

```

--> like you retrive censor details from MovieInfo its also possible to do Vice-Versa  to retrive the movie details using censorinfo model since they have one-one connection 



## one - to - many (1 Director -- many Movies)

use forign key in model where that model should exactly be connected to only one object of another model (ippo director(many) aanenkil movies modelil foreign key create cheyyu)


CASCADE :- if you deleted the censor info then automatically the movi info will be deleted 
protect :- prevents deletion 
restrict :- similar to protection but can be deleted if there is a restricted realtion ship 
set_null
set_default



```python
directed_by = models.ForeignKey(
    director,
    on_delete=models.CASCADE,
    related_name='directed_movie',
    null=True
)
```

| Part                            | Explanation                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `directed_by`                   | This is the name of the field in your model. It represents who directed the movie.                            |
| `models.ForeignKey`             | This defines a **many-to-one** relationship. Many movies can be directed by one director.                     |
| `director`                      | This should be the name of another model (e.g., `Director`). It's the related model.                          |
| `on_delete=models.CASCADE`      | If the director is deleted, all movies directed by them will also be deleted automatically.                   |
| `related_name='directed_movie'` | This allows you to access all movies by a director using `director.directed_movie.all()` in reverse relation. |
| `null=True`                     | This allows the `directed_by` field to be empty (NULL) in the database. It’s optional.                        |

### Summary:

This line creates a link between a movie and its director. If the director is deleted, their movies are also deleted. You can find all movies of a director easily using the `related_name`.

Let me know if you want an example to see how it works in practice.



## MANY-TO-MANY 

unlike one to many or one to one which just require one column to keep track example movie require one foreign key to keep track of director id whereas same director will be linked to
multiple keys 

but many-to-many an entire seperate table will be created to maintain the track of actor id as well as movie id 


# ✅ Day-11: Learning Query set api


# 📌 Django QuerySets & Field Lookups - Corrected and Structured Notes

## ✅ What is a QuerySet?

* A **QuerySet** is a collection (set) of queries to retrieve data from the database.
* QuerySets are **lazy**, meaning:

  * They don't hit the database until you explicitly ask for the data (e.g., when you loop over them or convert them to a list).

```python
all_movies = MovieInfo.objects.all()
```

---

## ✅ values()

* Returns **dictionary-like** objects (instead of model instances).
* Useful when you want only specific fields or for JSON serialization.

```python
movies = MovieInfo.objects.values()  
# Output: <QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'title': 'batman', 'year': 2023}, ...]>

movies = MovieInfo.objects.values('title', 'year')
```

---

## ✅ filter()

* Works like **WHERE** clause in SQL to filter results.

### Example 1: Single filter

```python
movies_2023 = MovieInfo.objects.filter(year=2023)
```

### Example 2: Multiple conditions (use comma `,` which means **AND** in Django)

```python
movies = MovieInfo.objects.filter(year=2020, title='batman')
```

If no match is found:

```python
print(movies)  
# Output: <QuerySet []>
```

### Example 3: Only title filter

```python
movies = MovieInfo.objects.filter(title='batman')
print(movies)  
# Output: <QuerySet [<MovieInfo: batman>]>
```

---

## ✅ exclude()

* Opposite of `filter()`. It excludes matching results.

```python
movies = MovieInfo.objects.exclude(title='batman')
```

---

## ✅ order\_by()

* Orders results based on field names.

```python
movies = MovieInfo.objects.order_by('year')  # Ascending
movies = MovieInfo.objects.order_by('-year') # Descending
```

---

## ✅ Field Lookups (Important)

Django provides **field lookups** for advanced filtering using double underscores `__`.

### 🔑 Basic Syntax:

```python
Model.objects.filter(fieldname__lookup='value')
```

| Lookup        | Meaning                        | Example                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `exact`       | Exact match                    | `filter(title__exact='batman')`       |
| `iexact`      | Case-insensitive exact         | `filter(title__iexact='Batman')`      |
| `contains`    | Field contains value           | `filter(title__contains='bat')`       |
| `icontains`   | Case-insensitive contains      | `filter(title__icontains='Bat')`      |
| `startswith`  | Field starts with value        | `filter(title__startswith='Bat')`     |
| `istartswith` | Case-insensitive starts with   | `filter(title__istartswith='bat')`    |
| `endswith`    | Field ends with value          | `filter(title__endswith='man')`       |
| `iendswith`   | Case-insensitive endswith      | `filter(title__iendswith='Man')`      |
| `in`          | Matches any value in list      | `filter(year__in=[2020, 2021, 2022])` |
| `gt`          | Greater than                   | `filter(year__gt=2020)`               |
| `lt`          | Less than                      | `filter(year__lt=2025)`               |
| `gte`         | Greater than or equal          | `filter(year__gte=2020)`              |
| `lte`         | Less than or equal             | `filter(year__lte=2025)`              |
| `range`       | Between two values (inclusive) | `filter(year__range=(2010, 2020))`    |

---

### Example: Actor Name (Related Field)

If you have a **ForeignKey** or **ManyToManyField** like `actors`:

```python
movies = MovieInfo.objects.filter(actors__name='Mohanlal')
```

---

### Example: Title starts with 'M'

```python
movies = MovieInfo.objects.filter(title__startswith='M')
```



# ✅ Day-12: **Cookies in Django**

---

## 🔗 Protocols (Basic Understanding)

* A **protocol** is a **set of rules** that define how communication happens between a **client** (browser) and a **server** (like Django).
* The most common protocol used on the web is **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**.

---

## 🌐 **HTTP Protocol: Stateless by Nature**

### ⚡ What is a **Stateless Protocol**?

1. **HTTP is Stateless**:

   * Every time your browser sends a request to a server (like Django), the server treats it as **new** and **unrelated to any previous request**.

2. **Example of Statelessness**:

   * Visit a page → Django responds.
   * Refresh the page → Django does **not remember you** or your last visit.

3. **How Django Manages This?**

   * Django uses:

     * **Cookies** → Data stored on the **client** side (browser).
     * **Sessions** → Data stored on the **server** side.

4. **Without Cookies/Sessions**:

   * Each interaction would be **disconnected**:

     * No login persistence.
     * No shopping cart memory.
     * No user preferences.

---

✅ **In Short:**

* **Stateless protocol** = No memory between requests.
* Django adds **cookies/sessions** to create **stateful** experiences.

---

## 🍪 Cookies in Django

### 🔑 How Do Cookies Work?

1. You visit a website → Browser sends a request.
2. Website server sends back a **cookie** along with the response.
3. The cookie is stored on your **computer (browser)**.
4. On the next visit, your browser **automatically sends the cookie back** to the server.
5. The server uses the cookie to **recognize you** or store/retrieve information.

---

## ✅ Django Cookie Example

```python
def cred(request):
    # Get the current 'visits' cookie value, default to 0 if it doesn't exist
    visits = int(request.COOKIES.get('visits', 0))
    
    # Increment the visit count
    visits = visits + 1

    # Get movie data from the database (example)
    movie_set = MovieInfo.objects.all()

    # Render the page with movie data and visit count
    response = render(request, 'cred.html', {'movies': movie_set, 'visit': visits})

    # Set the updated visit count in the cookie (value must be a string)
    response.set_cookie('visits', str(visits))

    return response
```

---

### 📝 Key Notes:

| Cookie Step             | Explanation                                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `request.COOKIES.get()` | Retrieves existing cookie (or default if missing).  |
| `set_cookie()`          | Sets/updates the cookie in the browser.             |
| Values must be strings  | Cookies only store **string** values, not integers. |
